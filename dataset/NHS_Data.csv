Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"['In most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"['Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases.', 'Most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply.', 'Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include:', 'pale skin', 'feeling tired and breathless', 'having repeated infections over a short space of time', 'unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds', 'high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above', 'night sweats', 'bone and joint pain', 'easily bruised skin', 'swollen lymph nodes (glands)', 'abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen', 'unexplained weight loss', 'a purple skin rash (purpura)']","['You will be given chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow.

CNS treatment involves injecting a drug, usually methotrexate lumbar puncture.', 'After this consolidation treatment there is a recovery period which is called interim maintenance. This is when more drugs will be given to try to keep the leukaemia in remission. The exact details will depend on which arm of treatment your child follows and will be discussed in detail by your child’s doctor as it depends on your child’s response to treatment so far.', 'Further doses of chemotherapy treatment, called ‘delayed intensification’, are given to kill off any remaining leukaemia cells.']"
